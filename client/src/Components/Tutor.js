            are never able to get them resolved just in time. They usually need
            to ask the teacher the next day in school and teachers are never
            able to help each child and many students feel shy to ask questions
            in public. Similarly, teachers or even parents may want some
            guidance or expertise in specific concepts/skills/topics Problem
            Statement: Empower students/teachers/parents/community at large to
            discover experts and seek expertise in online/offline modes.
            Description: Ability to identify experts across sectors within a
            particular geographical area/across geographies Verification of
            expert to be a trusted expert Incentivization for experts to get a
            platform Experts can also share content via DIKSHAâ€™s Viduadaan
